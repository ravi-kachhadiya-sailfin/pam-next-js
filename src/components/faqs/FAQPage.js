      question: <span onClick={() => expandFAQ === 1 ? setExpandFAQ(0) : setExpandFAQ(1)}>Why was PAM created?</span>,
      answer: (<AnswerNormalText>
        The COVID-19 pandemic significantly increased healthcare worker distress and mental health concerns. Although many healthcare workers’ distress has decreased as the pressures from COVID-19 have improved, some individuals may find that these stressors have left a more lasting impact on their mental health. We recognize the inordinate amount of burden this global crisis has placed on all of the individuals working in our healthcare system, which is why PAM was developed with healthcare workers in mind. Healthcare workers require support, tools and strategies that will fit into their schedules-- a toolkit that can adapt and change based on their preferences and progress.

          No, but you can add PAM to your home screen so that you can easily open PAM on your phone anytime you need it! It will look and perform much like it would as an app.

      question: <span onClick={() => expandFAQ === 2 ? setExpandFAQ(0) : setExpandFAQ(3)}>Who is PAM for?</span>,
      answer: (<AnswerNormalText>
        PAM was developed for the healthcare workforce, with input from a large variety of healthcare workers. We recognize that the healthcare workforce encompasses a wide range of types of professionals including doctors, nurses, technicians, front desk staff, scribes, housekeeping, EMT’s, home health aides and others. We also recognize that healthcare workers are in a variety of settings including hospitals, free standing clinics, patient homes, and long term care facilities. The stressors individuals faced from the pandemic may have differed based on their role or setting but few aspects of the healthcare workforce have not been impacted. This platform was designed for people who work in any of these roles and settings.

      answer: (<>
        <AnswerNormalText className="mb">
          The tools provided in PAM are based on strategies that have been proven effective when used in digital mental health, self-guided, or therapist-supported formats. The strategies were drawn from cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based therapies, acceptance and commitment therapy, and positive psychology. They have been shown to increase well-being in different formats.
